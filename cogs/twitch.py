    "I hope Maurice wins xD. I'm an Amazingx simp and he's just so hot!!! People get so swooned by the hair, and his muscles are so swole like when he stretches LOL! He's super good but also smarter than he looks, just like me xD",
    "My mom just entered my room and asked me to stop watching garbage. I told her that League of Legends was a respectable esport with millions of player around the world. She responded: ‚ÄúI know. I was talking about Amazingx, he's trash‚Äù KEKW.",
    "Amazingx is real. I don't care what you want to say. Amazingx isn't 'imaginary'. He posts real tweets, feels real emotions, makes real bad plays...All you trolls are MALDING because he doesn't reply to your twitch messages probably. Not me though.. I have full faith in him. That's why he replied to me a couple minutes ago when I talked to him...he literally replied? And said 'shut the fuck up??'",
    "Amazingx is fantastic, just needs to work on communication, map awareness, laning, vision control, csing, poking, landing skillshots, objective control, early game, mid game, late game, ganking, and getting kills",
    "Hey, Amazing! Big fan of the stream, I can't believe you're not playing professionally anymore..RIP. I guess that's what happens when you become a coach, lol. Anyways, I'm trying to learn to play Shaco. I just have a question about the skill build: Should I max Backstab like you got backstabbed by Nicothepico, Decieve like you decieved Misfits into thinking they were a playoffs team, or Hallucinate like you made Origin hallucinate about being able to win Worlds 2015?",
    "I want to date Amazing so bad. He is so cute and I love him so much. He has a cute smile and a cute face. He‚Äôs a gamer like me and has a amazing personality. I would love to tell him every night ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and rub his feet while he is streaming We would go out when he isn‚Äôt doing gamer stuff and have fun together. He is also really good at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own BF. God I want to date Amazing",
    "Who is amazing? üôÑü§≠ü§îü§´üò∞ in math: my solution ‚ûóüòä in history: my king üëëüò£ in art: my canvas üé®ü•≥ in science: my oxygen üí®üòù in geography: my world üåéü§Ø",
    "Last Saturday, I found Amazing wet and unconscious on a beach. I quickly asked a lifeguard to watch over him while I get help. The lifeguard walks away muttering that he 'doesnt watch washed up streamers'",
    "Jungle too complicated. I'd like to just rightclick the minimap once and autoclear every camp. Also: recalling should be automated once I killed the crab, else the skill ceiling is too high to differentiate between good and bad players"
