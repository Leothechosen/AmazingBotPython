To-Do:
- Expand Legends Of Runeterra when more API endpoints are released.
- Add Valorant group when API endpoints are released.
- If the Discord server becomes large enough and there's interest in it, generate a XvsX Tournament with community members.
- Rewrite code to be multi-server friendly where needed
