# AmazingBot

This is a Discord Bot for League of Legends former pro player Amazing's Discord Server. https://discord.gg/rmurNhS

Commands (Prefix is -) :
1. league
   - rank [Summoner_name][server]
   - profile [Summoner_name][server]
2. lor 
   - leaderboard [lor_region]

Planned future commands:
- Expanding the rank command to include top champions played, recent games, and progress in ranking by storing the last rank that was called. For example, if I were to call my own rank (MZLeothechosen: Plat IV 0LP) and then later when I get to Plat III and call rank again, show Plat III (+1) 34LP (+34), but in a cleaner way. Legends of Runeterra's rank will also be added to this command, as soon as it becomes feasible to do so. 
- If the Discord server becomes large enough and there's interest in it, generate a XvsX Tournament with community members.
