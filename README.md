# AmazingBotPython

This is a Discord Bot for League of Legends former pro player Amazing's Discord Server. https://discord.gg/rmurNhS

Current functionality:

- Updating a voice channel to show Amazing's local time to help with understanding his stream schedule.
- Announce when Amazing is streaming with different shouts
- Rank: Return a given League of Legends player's rank in all queues, including TFT.

Planned future functionality:
- Expanding the rank command to include top champions played, recent games, and progress in ranking by storing the last rank that was called, as well as adding Legends of Runeterra ranked information when it becomes possible.
For example, if I were to call my own rank (MZLeothechosen: Plat IV 0LP) and then later when I get to Plat III and call rank again, show Plat III (+1) 34LP (+34), but in a cleaner way.
- If the Discord server becomes large enough and there's interest in it, generate a XvsX Tournament with community members.
